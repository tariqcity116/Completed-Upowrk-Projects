To do the above task if your dotnet-monitor is deployed on Cloud9 IDE, you can use the following steps:

Open the dotnet-monitor configuration file. The default location of the configuration file is ~/.dotnet/monitor/config.json.
In the configuration file, add the following section:
"s3": {
    "bucket": "my-bucket",
    "region": "us-east-1"
}
Replace my-bucket with the name of your S3 bucket and us-east-1 with the region of your S3 bucket.
Save the configuration file.
Once you have saved the configuration file, dotnet-monitor will start downloading dump and trace files to your S3 bucket.

Here are the steps on how to open and edit the dotnet-monitor configuration file on Cloud9 IDE:

Open the Cloud9 IDE.
In the file explorer, navigate to the directory where dotnet-monitor is deployed.
Right-click on the config.json file and select "Open".
The config.json file will open in the Cloud9 IDE editor.
Add the s3 section to the configuration file.
Save the configuration file.
Once you have saved the configuration file, dotnet-monitor will start downloading dump and trace files to your S3 bucket.
